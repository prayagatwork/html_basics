i have learned about html ; where my few lecture notes are :
<!-- this is about heading tags.... -->
<!-- now we have paragraph tag which is same as the h7 and h8 only ..
    beacuse in html only till h6 there us comparison available  -->
     <!-- now we have anchor tag to interconnect the files  -->
      <!-- different types of list un-oredered , ordered, descriptive list -->
       <!-- use of ammete which help to optamise the code writing speed  -->
    <!-- ol>li*3 -->
    <!-- now we will have basic of tables and try to create our own -->
    <h2 id="pls">Stats</h2>        <!--use to join inter-page content -->

    <!-- ammete to do this in short
    table>(tr>td*3)*3 -->

    <!-- now we will loop at image and how to add that to our webpage -->
        <!-- now we are looking for some FORMATTING stuff -->

    <!-- basic paragraoh stuff like strinking, bold, italic, undeline -->
     <!-- superscript and subscript -->
     <!-- what we write that we got -->

      <!-- paragraph using emmete p{this is emmete for paragraph} -->
       <!-- p>p>p is emmete for nested para -->

          <!-- we can also have different section using emmete like 
    article + section -->

        <!-- here also we do have class and id (it is like object but not object)
    section.sec  emmete abrivation for class
    section#sec1 emmete abrivation for ids   -->

   <!-- group of code stored in single unit or single division 
    then it is known as div or division tag 
    where we combine them to have easy editing -->

     <!-- we have two different entitites classification 
        block:
        where block is where whole line from L2R is used for editing 
        and it activates new line property
        inline:
        here in inline the changes takes place for particular text and not for whole line
        and it does not activates new line -->

         <!-- we can also interconvert tags from black to inline and vise-versa -->

         
        <!-- now we are using navbar and some basic cocept of web dev -->

         <!-- here we have basic form tag to make a box of form
    then inside it we have input tag which has different types of input things like 
    radio button check box text fiel and etc..
    then we have label tag which provide label to the fields 
    it has create label screen reader and for tag 
    where for tag have the same id to the input tag -->
    <!-- label ka for and input ka id bhai bhai  -->

     <!-- placeolder attrubute is for that faded text used in input  -->
    <!-- we are also learing anout different input type  -->

    <!-- we can use fieldset for seggregation of different forms 
    where we can use legend to heading or give name to our form  -->
